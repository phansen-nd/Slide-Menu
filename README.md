# Slide-Menu
Patrick Hansen and Neal Sheehan

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a simple menu feature that slides out from the side of the screen. The inspiration came primarily from slide-out menu in the Google Maps app. The feature is designed with intuitive behaviors in mind - how would the user want to control the menu?

## Running the Project
The project should download and run on any screen size, with a fixed menu size (240p). The project only supports portrait orientation, just like the Google Maps app, and is designed for apps that only allow portrait orientation for the whole app. 

## Sources
We used [Ray Wenderlich's slide-out menu](https://www.raywenderlich.com/78568/create-slide-out-navigation-panel-swift) to get some sense for what kind of UI elements would help the user interact with the menu, but we ultimately went with a design much more like the Google Maps menu (menu slides out on top of main view as opposed to main view sliding over to reveal menu).
